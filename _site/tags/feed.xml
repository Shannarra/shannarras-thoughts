                <title>The Ride In The Woods</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalism&lt;/strong&gt; describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I enjoy going on motorcycle trips and stopping in small towns and enjoying drinks with the locals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella. It derives from the reductive aspects of Modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against Abstract expressionism and a bridge to Postminimal art practices. &lt;a title=&quot;Minimalism Source&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;{ Source }&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of&lt;em&gt; La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams&lt;/em&gt;. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music. The term “minimalist” often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has also been used to describe the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett, the films of Robert Bresson, the stories of Raymond Carver, and the automobile designs of Colin Chapman. The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe the Mensheviks.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Best Waves - Surfing In Spain</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surfing&lt;/strong&gt; is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Your surfing can get better on every turn, on every wave you catch. Learn to read the ocean better. A big part of my success has been wave knowledge.” &lt;cite&gt;Kelly Slater&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronised surfing, Manly Beach, New South Wales, 1938–46 The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/31830780&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/31830780&quot;&gt;Hey Ho Let&amp;#039;s Go Surfing&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/nathanoldfield&quot;&gt;Nathan Oldfield&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer’s own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Evening at the ocean&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three major subdivisions within standing-up surfing are long boarding and short boarding and these two have several major differences, including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave’s speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized a 78 feet (23.8 m) wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed, although this remains an issue of much contention amongst many surfers, given the difficulty of measuring a constantly changing mound of water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer’s own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Best Waves - Surfing In Spain</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surfing&lt;/strong&gt; is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Your surfing can get better on every turn, on every wave you catch. Learn to read the ocean better. A big part of my success has been wave knowledge.” &lt;cite&gt;Kelly Slater&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronised surfing, Manly Beach, New South Wales, 1938–46 The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Fox Village In Japan</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Japan is covered in magical and irresistibly cute animal sanctuaries. &lt;strong&gt;The Shrines of Ise&lt;/strong&gt; have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fox never found a better messenger than himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the programming of &lt;a title=&quot;Japan&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Japan’s&lt;/a&gt; traditional culture gradually weakened from 1945 on, individual Japanese began to exercise some personal choice in their private lives. But the newly mandated freedoms had a minimal effect on a number of key institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s educational, economical and political systems remained hidebound bulwarks of traditional behavior. The politically guided economic system in particular was able to generate enormous power that could be directed with the precision of a laser beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve species belong to the monophyletic group of Vulpes genus of &lt;strong&gt;“true foxes”&lt;/strong&gt;. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. Foxes are found on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox &lt;em&gt;(Vulpes vulpes)&lt;/em&gt; with about 47 recognized subspecies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fox changes his fur but not his habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World. { &lt;a title=&quot;Fox&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Famous ukiyo-e artists include Hokusai and Hiroshige. The fusion of traditional woodblock printing and Western art led to the creation of manga, a comic book format that is now popular within and outside Japan. Manga-influenced animation for television and film is called anime. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s. { &lt;a title=&quot;Ise Grand Shrine&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; }&lt;/p&gt;
